# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation hub. This collection of resources serves as the central entry point for team members, newcomers, and stakeholders to understand and navigate OctoAcme's standardized project management processes. Whether you're joining a new project, looking for specific process guidance, or seeking to understand how we deliver value to customers, you'll find the information you need here.

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme follows a customer-first, iterative approach to project delivery that emphasizes clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Our project management framework is built on core principles that prioritize customer value, small testable increments, and continuous learning. Each project is guided by a named Project Manager who coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications, working closely with a Product Manager who defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success.

Our project lifecycle begins with **Initiation**, where we validate business need, align stakeholders, and establish clear goals through a Project One-pager that defines the problem statement, success metrics, and initial timeline. During **Planning**, we break down work into manageable pieces, identify dependencies, create detailed backlogs, and establish milestones with clear acceptance criteria. The **Execution & Tracking** phase leverages project boards, sprint rhythms, daily standups, and weekly delivery syncs to maintain momentum while our pull request workflow ensures quality through automated testing, code reviews, and CI/CD integration.

Throughout the project lifecycle, we maintain robust **Risk Management & Communication** practices including a risk register that tracks impact, likelihood, and mitigation plans, alongside structured stakeholder updates and clear escalation paths. Our **Release & Deployment** process follows standardized checklists, includes comprehensive testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end), and maintains rollback playbooks for incident response. Finally, every project concludes with **Retrospectives & Continuous Improvement**, where we conduct post-milestone reviews, capture learnings in action items, and apply insights to enhance future delivery.

Key personas include Developers who implement features and maintain quality standards, Product Managers who define customer value and prioritize work, Project Managers who coordinate delivery and manage risk, QA Leads/Test Engineers who validate acceptance criteria and manage test automation, UX/UI Designers who create user-centered designs, Tech Leads/Solution Architects who provide technical leadership, Business Analysts who gather requirements and validate business outcomes, Support/Customer Success Managers who ensure customer satisfaction, and Stakeholders who provide inputs and approvals. Our communication cadence includes weekly PM-PdM syncs, twice-weekly team standups, monthly stakeholder updates, and regular demos, all supported by key artifacts such as project charters, roadmaps, risk registers, design specifications, and retrospective notes.
