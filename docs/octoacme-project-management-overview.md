# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

## Purpose
Provide a concise, shareable introduction to how OctoAcme runs projects so new teammates can quickly understand our approach, roles, and key artifacts.

## Scope
Applies to all cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, or integrations.

## Principles
- Customer-first: prioritize customer value and usability.
- Iterative delivery: deliver small, testable increments.
- Clear ownership: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- Data-informed decisions: measure impact and iterate based on evidence.
- Psychological safety: encourage feedback and learning.

## Core Roles
The following roles work together to deliver successful projects:

**Leadership & Coordination:**
- **Project Manager (PM):** Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, communications.
- **Product Manager (PdM):** Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success.
- **Tech Lead / Solution Architect:** Provides technical leadership and architectural guidance.

**Design & User Experience:**
- **UX/UI Designer:** Creates user-centered designs and validates usability.

**Development & Quality:**
- **Developers:** Implement features, collaborate on design and testability.
- **QA Lead / Test Engineer:** Validate quality, acceptance criteria, and test automation.

**Requirements & Analysis:**
- **Business Analyst:** Gathers requirements, documents processes, and validates business outcomes.

**Customer-Facing:**
- **Support / Customer Success Manager:** Ensures customer satisfaction, handles escalations, and provides product feedback.

**Other:**

## Lifecycle (high-level)
1. Initiation: problem statement, stakeholders, high-level timeline.
2. Planning: scope, resources, milestones, dependencies.
